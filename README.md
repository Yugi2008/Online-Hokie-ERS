# **Game Rules:**

1. The gameplay goes as follows, players take turns playing cards face-up into a central pile. The goal is to slap the pile when certain combinations of cards appear. The combinations that trigger a slap include:

* **Double:** When two cards of the same rank are played consecutively (Ex. two Aces).

* **Sandwich:** When a card of one rank is played with two cards of another rank between them (Ex. King, Ace, King).
                           
* **Marriage:** When a Queen is played followed by a King, or vice versa.

* **Three in a Row:** When three cards with consecutive ranks are played  (Ascending/Descending)

2. When the valid combination appears, any player can slap the pile. The first player to slap the pile after a valid combination is played wins the pile and adds it to their own stack of cards.
3. If a player slaps the pile when no valid combination is present, they must give one card from their stack to the bottom of the middle pile.
4. The game continues until one player accumulates all the cards. That player is declared the winner.
